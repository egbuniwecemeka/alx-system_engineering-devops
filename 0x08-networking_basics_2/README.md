The checker is running on Docker, so make sure to read this

--------------------------------------------------------------
Docker treats /etc/hosts differently. It overwrites it whenever it wants without any regard for your modifications.
To solve this you can run this workaround:

cp /etc/hosts ~/hosts.new
sed ... ~/hosts.new
cp -f ~/hosts.new /etc/hosts
You can change the sed command with that you want.
