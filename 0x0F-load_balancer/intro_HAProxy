# HAProxy Terminology
# ACL
# test conditions and take actions based on those test results

# Backend
# Backend caan be defined by the load balance algorithm to use
# and a list of servers and ports


# adding more servers to your backend will increase your potential load capacity by spreading
# the load over multiple servers. Increased reliability is also achieved through this manner,

# Example of 2 backend configuration where each contains 2 servers and ports
backend web-egbuniwe
  # balance roundrobin line specifies the load balancing algorithm
  balance roundrobin
  server web-01 web-01.yourdomain.com:80 check
  server web-02 web-02.yourdomain.com:80 check

backend images-egbuniwe
  balance roundrobin
  # mode http specifies that layer 7 proxying will be used,
  mode http
  server images images.yourdomain.com:80 check
  server images images.yourdomain.com:80 check

# Types of Load Balancing
# No Load balancing
# Layer 4 Load Balancing(Transport layer)
# Load balancing this way will forward user traffic based on IP range and port
